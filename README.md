# Deterministic-Finite-Automata

This is a Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA) which either accepts or rejects incoming input alphabets. 
A DFA , in theory of computation, is a finite state machine that either accepts or rejects input alphabets. 
The DFA is made up of :
1. a finite set of states 
2. a finite set Σ of symbols (alphabet)
3. a transition function that takes as argument a state and a
symbol and returns a state (often denoted δ)
4. a start state 
5. a set of final or accepting states
